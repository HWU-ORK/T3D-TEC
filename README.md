# T3D-TEC
This repository provides a tool to implement the effects of tidal energy converters (TECs) on the flow in TELEMAC-3D regional hydrodynamic modelling software.

The tool allows representing full-scale turbines in the TELEMAC-3D model as an actuator disc where the thrust force of the turbine is distributed across the swept area of the turbine blades.
